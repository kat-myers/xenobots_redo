In the latest update, I create 3D, randomly-generated creatures. Each creature consists of a root link, called a torso, and has the opportunity to 
generate 0 to 4 segments at each branching point from the torso. The creatures can have 0 to 4 branching points, which are connected via joints at random
values along the face of the torso. A diagram for how these creatures are generated is shown below:
https://github.com/kat-myers/xenobots_redo/blob/main/A7_Creature_Generation.png (inspiration for diagram from Karl Sims)

Each branch's segments are random sizes between .2 and 1, and are connected via joints at random points on the previous segment's face. The joints 
have been modified so that they can now be generated diagonally using "roll-pitch-yaw" arguments passed when the joint is defined.

Each of these joints has a motor neuron, and each link has a 50% chance of gaining a sensor neuron.
Links without sensors are blue, and links with sensor are green. An example is below:

The creatures are also generated to minimize intersection with other segments. Adjacent cubes are allowed to intersect, but nonadjancent cubes or cubes from different
branches are stopped from doing so by checking that the next generated cube will not generate into a position where a cube already exists

The creatures are given an opportunity to evolve. This is done by beginnning a population
with randomly generated creatures, and evaluating the fitness, defined as the ability of the
snakes to move in the y direction:
   stateOfLinkZero = p.getLinkState(self.robotId,0)
        positionOfLinkZero = stateOfLinkZero[1]
        yCoordinateOfLinkZero = positionOfLinkZero[1]
The creatures with the highest fitness are then randomly mutated and allowed to evolve, seeding
the next generation. This is repeated for a certain number of generations with a certain population
size in each, defined in my constants.py file.
   
To run this simulation, clone my directory, and run "py search.py" in your terminal :)
Enjoy!!
