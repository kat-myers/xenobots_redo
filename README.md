## Info
In this branch (a7), I create a 3D morphology that has a random number (between 1 and 7) of links with a random number of sensors (between 1 and # of links) in a chain. Links will not go through the ground or intersect. Link length, width, and height are chosen by selecting a random float between 0.2 and 0.5. The first link always has length, width, and height of 0.5. Sensors are randomly selected and the links with sensors are colored green. Links without sensors are blue. An example is shown below:

Shown below is a description on how bodies and brains are generated:

## Recreate
You can run this code by cloning branch a7 and running 'python search.py' in your terminal.
